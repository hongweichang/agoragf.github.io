<h1>Agora, global festivals</h1>
<!-- useless <p>This site should be extended material about method presented at <a href="http://participedia.net/en/methods/agora-global-festivals" target="_blank">participedia.org Apr 29 '15.</a> For last edits see  <a href="https://github.com/AgoraGF/agoragf.github.io" target="_blank">GitHub repo.</a> There might be too much structure at the beginning, that helps me to keep logical structure, excuse it for this moment please, we may streamline it later.
<h2>Philosophy</h2>
<p>Philosophy is a bad start for popular site, but o good start for thinking, so let us start with it.</p>
<p>
First of all we should get rid of common errors. We do not expect any meaning of universe, we are just acting with some limited free will. We should get rid of self-fulfilling prophecies of international neoliberalism. Especially should be said that there is very limited knowledge about human nature. Also we should not talk much about self-defeating prophecies. And we should forget about reality where things could be undone, we expect causality.</p>
<p>Now we may let Bookchin<sup><a href="https://libcom.org/files/Murray_Bookchin_The_Ecology_of_Freedom_1982.pdf" target="_blank">[book.pdf]</a></sup> to do the basic philosophical construction and support him with Altemayer<sup><a href="http://members.shaw.ca/jeanaltemeyer/drbob/TheAuthoritarians.pdf#page=8" target="_blank">[book.pdf]</a></sup>. We see that Bookchin may be impractical some of his solutions, but we accept basic argumentation and conclusion that we should challenge hierarchy to see where it is necessary.</p>




<p>Violence we expect to be impractical for our purposes, there are more effective non-violent methods elaborated e.g. by <a href="http://www.aeinstein.org/">Albert Einstein Institution</a></p>

<h3>Definition</h3><p>method utilizes the suitable of fundamental human needs and diminish the effect of other needs and maladaptations in deliberative democracy.</p><h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><p>This method is designed for decision-making and social choice. It solves non-participation, media influence, scalability, language barriers, Spam, digital divide, aggression and authoritarianism by Altemayer<sup><a href="http://members.shaw.ca/jeanaltemeyer/drbob/TheAuthoritarians.pdf#page=8" target="_blank">[book.pdf]</a></sup>. </p><p>Events are scalable to whole population. Hundreds participants per agora, where number of agoras is unlimited.</p><h3>History</h3><p>This method is under development. There is an atempt to establish first agora of this method.</p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p>Everybody may come in pairs. Participants are encouraged to bring things on this list into agora: food, drinks, games, single color party hats,&nbsp; music, electronics, books, notes and businesses related to this items. This list may be limited according to previous local agora decisions.</p><p>Participants</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p>At the entrances written proposals are registered and entered as an option into opinion poll. Every proposal must contain decision rule e.g. decisive majority or super-majority. Proposals with potentially higher sunk costs, should have higher super-majority. Opinion polls collect approvals to proposals within agora for a limited time and return back. Proposals are placed on information boards with descending chances for reaching decision rule and a color is associated with the top proposals. Proposals with no support are discarded. Colors are used to indicate support to top proposals. The easiest way is to wear a party hat in the color of the most top proposal individual supports. At the moment when is the support in opinion polls for the top proposal peaking above decion rule , moderator announces that everybody who wants to should wear the top color now and that there will be a photo. If colors support the opinion poll results, proposal is accepted. Photo of agora is taken as an evidence and uploaded with the text of the accepted proposal on official public websites. Participants should be able to see it in a few minutes. Moderator speaks quite rarely and&nbsp; may be replaced.</p><p><br />In the meantime citizens are encouraged to talk in mixed pairs. For those who are willing to play, social games may be used to establish new pairs or exchange partners. In pairs they may talk about the proposals on information boards or their own ideas. Individual citizens may search public website with accepted proposals from other agoras and may translate and register them as local proposals. It is recommended to mark translated proposals and get some support before registration or the proposal may be discarded after a few opinion polls. Citizens from concurrent agoras may also talk to each other using electronics, this may support the feeling of globality.</p><p>At the moment when there is less than 30 participants in an agora, the process might be simplified. Registration and voting might be performend directly on a board. At the end of the party participants take a photo with the board.</p><p>When starting with one person (you), it is recommended to invite personally reachable people of higher social status to the first assembly. When inviting them, give them a peace of paper for new proposal and try to help them to create one proposal.</p><p>First agoras with less participants (when growing it for the first time) may use simpler methods of decision making, e.g. papers with Short Heading, Decision rule, Proposal text and a grid for votes. Email me for more.</p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p>Proposals should be individually executable, there should be funding section in every proposal.<br /><br />The process should produce high quality decisions by design. Majority of citizens will know the decision at the time when is accepted.</p><h3>Analysis and Lessons Learned</h3><p>This concept needs improvement. Email us, join us.&nbsp; e97531<code>@</code>zoho.com</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>Most important first:</p><p>http://members.shaw.ca/jeanaltemeyer/drbob/TheAuthoritarians.pdf</p><h3>External Links</h3><p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_costs</p><p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_human_needs</p><h3>Notes</h3><p>Just internal notes to be considered later.</p><p>http://cdd.stanford.edu/mm/2014/luskin-online.pdf</p><p>May be similar to garden party.</p><p>Masks may be forbidden at the entry, allowed in agora.</p>
