<p>This project is most important.</p>
<p>This project is designed to be important as human lives. It is about happiness, group decision-making and society.</p>
<p>How it this project different? There great number of projects with similar goal, what make us different is memetics. This project is not just functional, it is designed to propagate itself, because you can easily share and talk about the funny part of the event and do not need to embarrass yourself with "nerd stuff". For more read <a href="http://www.sethgodin.com/ideavirus/downloads/IdeavirusReadandShare.pdf" target="_blank">Unleashing the ideavirus</a>. Another difference is our precaution to authoritarianism. We do not let social dominators to ruin the whole discussion with rhetorics and we better share informations, including private information, in pairs to understand each other more.

<p>Still, it is easy and you can do it!</p>
<p>I am still working on the project <a href="http://spobu.github.io/" target="_blank"> Společenská burza</a> in Czech Republic and I got some good news. I think that, if you read this, you are quite certainly able to coordinate similar project.</p>

<div>
<p>Take a notepad and ask your neighbor, what may improve local life. Ask her for help with project. </p>
<p> It is easy, copy some known abstract ideas from Community Building Activities at <a href="http://www.citizenshandbook.org/toc.html" target="_blank">The Citizen's handbook</a>. Visit one person at the place where are you living and ask her for some ideas that may improve the place and provide the list of known ideas for inspiration. Write everything down. Now tell her that you want do organize a social event (Agora), where people will talk privately -privately that is important- privately about their and her ideas. Tell her that you aim to improve local life, that you want to do it in a pleasant way. Invite her and ask for some help for the Agora. Ask her for contact information for invitation and also whether she knows somebody around that is free to talk. At the end ask her for some more ideas or even some feedback to your skills/work on the project. Write down your notes. Try to improve your presentation and place the best ideas on top of the list, but show just one page of ideas with a note that there is more of them. Do not add your own ideas, let somebody else to be brilliant too.</p>

<p>After you visit your first neighbor <a href="https://michalstepanek.github.io" target="_blank">contact me</a> please, somebody do have to tell you have great you are. Also this method is always under development and every information is appreciated.</p>

</div>

<div>
<p>Ask more locals, share their ideas and get volunteers.</p>
<p>Repeat previous paragraph in the smallest reasonable local area till you have enough support to organize the Agora. Then book some facility and create invitations. You may make it very personal invitation, if the youngest volunteers write and color some invitations.</p>

<div>
<p>Throw a party, conduct short surveys, share results and get some cash. </p>
<p>Now to the Agora. It should be fun. For success try to satisfy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_human_needs" target="_blank">fundamental human needs</a>. The underlying core process is also part of the needs. Decorate yourself, Surveyors, Researcher and people that propagate some idea, use sashes or party hats. Surveyors randomly approach people and ask them for a short survey, cca 15 yes/no questions, contact info and new ideas with labels. There are basically tree overlapping labels for ideas, first collects "guests", second collects "volunteers", the last collects "votes". "guests" do need to specify entrance fee. "volunteers" do need to specify desired skills or sum of needed donations. "votes" should have threshold. Surveyors go back to Researcher to aggregate, sort, select and publish the collected information. The most supported ideas collecting "votes" should be published on a board. The first board may be improvised e.g. rope, clothespins and letter on A4 papers. Lastly you may ask for voluntary entrance fee or other forms of donation.</p>

<div>
<p>Implement some ideas.</p>
<p>Make sure that your project will initiate some physical action before you throw another party.</p>
<p>... under construction ...</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>Throw another party. Take a picture of support.</p>
<p>With time Agora should become more complex. The board should gradually get more importance and more "votes" with threshold. Finally when Researcher finds out that support for some "vote" is peaking above threshold, you shortly announce that there might be a vote within some period - that is time for laggards to find out more about the vote. Voting may be done by sashes, party hats or hand raising or combined, depends on what is popular. Take a picture and count the people later.</p>

</div>

<div>
<p> Upload the picture, count the people and publish.</p>
<p> Next level is information system that connects the agoras, a geographical map of Agoras with decisions.</p>
<p>Why should I count the people?Well, it may be an indicator of good decision for other visitors. It is also possible to estimate a longterm validity of this decision. In later research, we will focus on super-majorities and opinion shifts in time.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>Follow other Agoras, translate and propagate good decisions.</p>

<p>
First of all we should get rid of common errors. We do not expect any meaning of universe, we are just acting with some limited free will. We should get rid of self-fulfilling prophecies of international neoliberalism. Especially should be said that there is very limited knowledge about human nature. Also we should not talk much about self-defeating prophecies. And we should forget about reality where things could be undone, we expect causality.</p><p>... under construction ...</p>

<p>Now we may let Bookchin<sup><a href="https://libcom.org/files/Murray_Bookchin_The_Ecology_of_Freedom_1982.pdf" target="_blank">[book.pdf]</a></sup> to do the basic philosophical construction and support him with Altemayer<sup><a href="http://members.shaw.ca/jeanaltemeyer/drbob/TheAuthoritarians.pdf#page=8" target="_blank">[book.pdf]</a></sup>. We see that Bookchin may be impractical some of his solutions, but we accept basic argumentation and conclusion that we should challenge hierarchy to see where it is necessary.</p><p>... under construction ...</p>

</div><h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><div>
<p>This method is designed for decision-making and social choice. It solves non-participation, media influence, scalability, language barriers, Spam, digital divide, aggression and authoritarianism by Altemayer<sup><a href="http://members.shaw.ca/jeanaltemeyer/drbob/TheAuthoritarians.pdf#page=8" target="_blank">[book.pdf]</a></sup>. </p><p>... under construction ...</p>

<p>This method is under development. There is an atempt to establish first agora of this method.</p><p>... under construction ...</p>

</div><h3>Participant Selection</h3><div>
<p>Everybody may come in pairs. Participants are encouraged to bring things on this list into agora: food, drinks, games, single color party hats,&nbsp; music, electronics, books, notes and businesses related to this items. This list may be limited according to previous local agora decisions.</p><p>... under construction ...</p>

</div><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><div>
<p>At the entrances written proposals are registered and entered as an option into opinion poll. Every proposal must contain decision rule e.g. decisive majority or super-majority. Proposals with potentially higher sunk costs, should have higher super-majority. Opinion polls collect votes to proposals within agora for a limited time and return back. Proposals are placed on information boards with descending chances for reaching decision rule and a color is associated with the top proposals. Proposals with no support are discarded. Colors are used to indicate support to top proposals. The easiest way is to wear a party hat in the color of the most top proposal individual supports. At the moment when is the support in opinion polls for the top proposal peaking above decion rule , moderator announces that everybody who wants to should wear the top color now and that there will be a photo. If colors support the opinion poll results, proposal is accepted. Photo of agora is taken as an evidence and uploaded with the text of the accepted proposal on official public websites. Participants should be able to see it in a few minutes. Moderator speaks quite rarely and&nbsp; may be replaced.</p><p>... under construction ...</p>

</div><div>
<p><br />In the meantime citizens are encouraged to talk in mixed pairs. For those who are willing to play, social games may be used to establish new pairs or exchange partners. In pairs they may talk about the proposals on information boards or their own ideas. Individual citizens may search public website with accepted proposals from other agoras and may translate and register them as local proposals. It is recommended to mark translated proposals and get some support before registration or the proposal may be discarded after a few opinion polls. Citizens from concurrent agoras may also talk to each other using electronics, this may support the feeling of globality.</p><p>... under construction ...</p>

</div><div>
<p>At the moment when there is less than 30 participants in an agora, the process might be simplified. Registration and voting might be performend directly on a board. At the end of the party participants take a photo with the board.</p><p>... under construction ...</p>

<p>When starting with one person (you), it is recommended to invite personally reachable people of higher social status to the first assembly. When inviting them, give them a peace of paper for new proposal and try to help them to create one proposal.</p><p>... under construction ...</p>

<p>First agoras with less participants (when growing it for the first time) may use simpler methods of decision making, e.g. papers with Short Heading, Decision rule, Proposal text and a grid for votes. Email me for more.</p><p>... under construction ...</p>

</div><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><div>
<p>Proposals should be individually executable, there should be funding section in every proposal.<br /><br />The process should produce high quality decisions by design. Majority of citizens will know the decision at the time when is accepted.</p><p>... under construction ...</p>
