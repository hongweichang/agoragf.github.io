<h3>Definition</h3><p>method utilizes the suitable of fundamental human needs and diminish the effect of other needs and maladaptations in deliberative democracy.</p><h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><p>This method is designed for decision-making and social choice. It solves non-participation, media influence, scalability, language barriers, Spam, digital divide, aggression and authoritarianism by Altemayer<sup><a href="http://members.shaw.ca/jeanaltemeyer/drbob/TheAuthoritarians.pdf#page=8" target="_blank">[1.9 MB.pdf]</a></sup>. Minimal costs and requirements are low: good weather, chalk and one reliable citizen with camera.</p><p>Events are scalable to whole population. Hundreds participants per agora, where number of agoras is unlimited.</p><h3>History</h3><p>This method is under development. There is an atempt to establish first agora of this method.</p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p>Everybody may come in pairs. Participants are encouraged to bring things on this list into agora: food, drinks, games, single color party hats,&nbsp; music, electronics, books, notes and businesses related to this items. This list may be limited according to previous local agora decisions.</p><p>Participants</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p>At the entrances written proposals are registered and entered as an option into opinion poll. Every proposal must contain decision rule e.g. decisive majority or super-majority. Proposals with potentially higher sunk costs, should have higher super-majority. Opinion polls collect approvals to proposals within agora for a limited time and return back. Proposals are placed on information boards with descending chances for reaching decision rule and a color is associated with the top proposals. Proposals with no support are discarded. Colors are used to indicate support to top proposals. The easiest way is to wear a party hat in the color of the most top proposal individual supports. At the moment when is the support in opinion polls for the top proposal peaking above decion rule , moderator announces that everybody who wants to should wear the top color now and that there will be a photo. If colors support the opinion poll results, proposal is accepted. Photo of agora is taken as an evidence and uploaded with the text of the accepted proposal on official public websites. Participants should be able to see it in a few minutes. Moderator speaks quite rarely and&nbsp; may be replaced.</p><p><br />In the meantime citizens are encouraged to talk in mixed pairs. For those who are willing to play, social games may be used to establish new pairs or exchange partners. In pairs they may talk about the proposals on information boards or their own ideas. Individual citizens may search public website with accepted proposals from other agoras and may translate and register them as local proposals. It is recommended to mark translated proposals and get some support before registration or the proposal may be discarded after a few opinion polls. Citizens from concurrent agoras may also talk to each other using electronics, this may support the feeling of globality.</p><p>At the moment when there is less than 30 participants in an agora, the process might be simplified. Registration and voting might be performend directly on a board. At the end of the party participants take a photo with the board.</p><p>When starting with one person (you), it is recommended to invite personally reachable people of higher social status to the first assembly. When inviting them, give them a peace of paper for new proposal and try to help them to create one proposal.</p><p>First agoras with less participants (when growing it for the first time) may use simpler methods of decision making, e.g. papers with Short Heading, Decision rule, Proposal text and a grid for votes. Email me for more.</p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p>Proposals should be individually executable, there should be funding section in every proposal.<br /><br />The process should produce high quality decisions by design. Majority of citizens will know the decision at the time when is accepted.</p><h3>Analysis and Lessons Learned</h3><p>This concept needs improvement.
